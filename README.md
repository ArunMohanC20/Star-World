Hello Guys... This is a project which accepts users image and predict which star constellation it belong to.
I had done this using the help of an machine learning model which is developed on google collab and i uses the flask app as a server for hosting the model with the help of html,css and js
I had uploaded the google collab code along with my index.html and style.css files and also added the dataset ehich i used to train and test the model
